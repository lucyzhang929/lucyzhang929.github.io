In this course, most of the preparations have already been done within the database, but you will still convert certain values to factors, making them categorical, creating rolling windows for the maintenance and other tasks.\r\n\r\nYou'll use a Notebook environment to work with your model. You're doing that in this course as a learning exercise, but this is also a common way of working with a Data Science project. It's also common to use Notebooks to work with Azure Machine Learning Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Cosmos DB or other tools to explore your data, create an experiment, and create and train a model.\r\n\r\nNote: The key to a Hybrid Machine Learning Scenario is that you create that model in one location, store the results as a serialized model (using Python's \"Pickle\" function, R-serialization, the ONNX standard or other binary streaming) and then bring that model in to a local environment using an engine like SQL Server ML Services or [ML.NET with ONNX](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/10/08/announcing-ml-net-0-6-machine-learning-net/) to do the predictions (scoring).\r\n\r\n",

This step is called *training the model*. The training dataset will be a subset of the entire dataset. In the next exercise you are going to create the model using the Features from the previous exercise. \r\n\r\nIn production, you will use multiple algorithms and variables (called *hyperparameters*) to find the best model. This is called an *experiment*. Once you are satisfied with that experiment's outputs, you can save it as a trained Model. In this case, you'll focus on one algorithm, and use that. You will, however, see how to evaluate the model, which you would do with each run (experiment).\r\n\r\nYou'll use one set of data to train your model, and another other to test how well it performed. In this activity you will segment the testing and training data. This is a process you should repeat with different ways of separating this data, since one parameter or another might have factors that unduly weight the results.\r\n\r\nUsing the K-Means model, you'll group the data. K-Means accepts two inputs: The data itself, and a predefined number *k*, the number of clusters. The output is `k` clusters with input data partitioned among them.\r\n\r\nThe goal of K-means is to group the items into *k* clusters such that all items in same cluster are as similar to each other as possible, and items not in same cluster are as different as possible. It uses the distance measures to calculate similarity and dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nThis is how the algorithm works: \r\n\r\n- It randomly chooses *k* points and make them the initial centroids (each cluster has a centroid which basically is the “center” of the cluster). \r\n- For each point, it finds the nearest centroid and assigns the point to the cluster associated with the nearest centroid\r\n- It then updates the centroid of each cluster based on members in that cluster. Typically, a new centroid will be the average of all members in the cluster\r\n- Finally it repeats steps 2 and 3, until the clusters are stable\r\n\r\nThe number of clusters has to be predefined and the quality of the clusters is heavily dependent on the correctness of the k value specified. You could just randomly pick a number of clusters, run K-Means and iterate your way to a good number. Or we can use R to evaluate which number of clusters is best for our dataset. Let’s determine the number of clusters using an R client this time, with the database serving as the data source. (You're not meant to run all of this code, but you certainly could, if you make the connection to the database properly). \r\n\r\nYou should also check out `sqlmlutils`  - a package designed to [help you interact with SQL databases and execute R or Python code in SQL from an R/Python client](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlmlutils).",
