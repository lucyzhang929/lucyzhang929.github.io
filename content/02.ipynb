Using Machine Learning Services inside a database engine allows you to keep the data integrity you have built into your RDBMS, provides a high level of security, the ability to work on premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid fashion, and eliminates data travel outside your database environment. It also allows your data professionals to work in the area they know well, and still allow Data Scientists to work with R or Python to perform predictive, clustering, and categorical models with easy deployment. This course shows an example of training and deploying a Machine Learning model, making predictions on data in-house.\r\n\r\nTo begin, it's best to focus not on the technologies you will use, but the process you can follow to determine the best solution. It's important to involve the right team members in the project, especially where security is involved. The activities typically involved in an Advanced Analytics project contain the following steps:\r\n\r\n <table style=\"width: 75%; tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: #f2f2f2;}; text-align: left; display: table; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 2px; border-color: gray;\">\r\n\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th style=\"background-color: #1b20a1; color: white;\">Step</th>\r\n    <th style=\"background-color: #1c6afc; color: white;\">Description</th>\r\n    <th style=\"background-color: #1b20a1; color: white;\">Typical Deliverable</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>Discovery</b></td>\r\n    <td>Initial Contact between technical teams, consultants, and business owners. <br><i>Outcome: Problem statement definition</i></td>\r\n    <td><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLServerMLServices/assets/Project/1%20-%20Discovery.docx\" target=\"_blank\">Discovery Word Document</a></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>Envisioning</b></td>\r\n    <td>Technical team and consultants develop initial components of proposed solution. <br><i>Outcome: Team briefing on the decision points for creating a solution</i></td>\r\n    <td><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLServerMLServices/assets/Project/2%20-%20Envisioning.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Envisioning PowerPoint</a></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>Architecture Design Session (ADS)</b></td>\r\n    <td>Using the decision points from the previous phase, the technical team selects the components for a Proof of Concept exercise. <br><i>Outcome: ADS Diagram and explanation of decisions</i></td>\r\n    <td><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLServerMLServices/assets/Project/3%20-%20ADS%20Decision%20Tree.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">ADS Decision Matrix Excel Sheet</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/SQLServerMLServices/assets/Project/3%20-%20ADS.vsdx\" target=\"_blank\">ADS Visio Template</a></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>Proof-Of-Concept (POC)</b></td>\r\n    <td>A small version of the solution is created, using the actual data flow.

It combines the processes from working with data with technology, and also the scientific process.\r\n\r\n[**NOTE:** You can learn more about the questions Data Science can answer here.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/data-science-for-beginners-series-the-5-questions-data-science-answers/)\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/DataAndScience.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo work in the Data Science field, it's helpful to have a background in various maths families (linear algebra, statistics, even formal logic), computing data technologies (such as programming in functional and object-oriented languages, database technologies such as NoSQL and RDBMS's, and \"Big Data\" areas such as Spark) and a \"domain\" of knowledge in some general area (finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing and such) or a broad knowledge in many industries.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/NeedToKnow.png?raw=true\" width=\"200\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe Data Scientist performs multiple types of analysis, from historical descriptive evaluations through predictive and prescriptive analysis.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/TypesOfAnalysis.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo do predictive and prescriptive analysis, the Data Science team leverages *Machine Learning*. Machine Learning technologies consume large amounts of data in the form of *Features* (columns of data that are predictive or classifying in nature) and *Labels* (the data you want to predict or classify). For instance, knowing where someone grew up or traveled to can give you insight into the types of food they might like to eat.\r\n\r\nThere are various \"families\" of algorithms that you can use to answer questions. They include the following:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/MLCapabilities.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMachine Learning uses algorithms to create (train) a completed *Model*. The training looks at various Features and \"learns\" how it affects a supplied \"Label\". It then selects the best path to work with data it has *not* seen. You can then send new data (Features) and the Model will return it's guess for the Label, usually along with how confident it is in the guess.\r\n\r\nMachine Learning is used in both Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. You can see this interaction here:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/AIDLProcess.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMachine Learning, when layered in certain ways, forms the concept of *Deep Learning*. Machine Learning also forms the basis for Artificial Intelligence, which normally involves adding in \"sensory\" areas like vision, text and language.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/AIProgression.png?raw=true\" width=\"500\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThere are various Platforms you can use to implement Machine Learning, such as Spark, Hadoop, AzureML and more. In this course you'll focus on using the SQL Server Platform to create, train, and deploy your completed predictive Model.",

We refer to these variables as the model targets, and we use the metrics associated with them to determine the success of the project.\r\n\r\nYou've actually already done this step in the first three phases of the project we've been creating. You can take the outputs you created and include them as the assets for this step described in the documentation reference.\r\n\r\n<h4>Phase Two - Data Acquisition and Understanding</h4>\r\n\r\nRead the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-data)\r\n\r\nThe Data Acquisition and Understanding phase of the TDSP you ingest or access data from various locations to answer the questions the organization has asked. In most cases, this data will be in multiple locations. Once the data is ingested into the system, you’ll need to examine it to see what it holds. All data needs cleaning, so after the inspection phase, you’ll replace missing values, add and change columns. You’ve already seen the Libraries you'll need to work with for Data Wrangling - Pandas being the most common in use.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;\"></p>\r\n<h4>Phase Three - Modeling</h4>\r\n\r\nIn this phase, you will create the experiment runs, perform feature engineering, and run experiments with various settings and parameters. After selecting the best performing run, you will create a trained model and save it for operationalization in the next phase. This modeling is done with yet another set of Python Libraries - the most common being SciKit Learn and TensorFlow, You'll see this in action in just a bit.\r\n\r\nRead the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-modeling)\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;\"></p>\r\n<h4>Phase Four - Deployment</h4>\r\n\r\nIn this phase you will take the trained model and any other necessary assets and deploy them to a system that will respond to API requests.\r\n\r\nRead the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-deployment)\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;\"></p>\r\n<h4>Phase Five - Customer Acceptance</h4>\r\n\r\nThe final phase involves testing the model predictions on real-world queries to ensure that it meets all requirements. In this phase we also document the project so that all parameters are well-known. Finally, a mechanism is created to re-train the model.\r\n\r\nRead the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-acceptance)\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;\"></p>\r\n",

For each area, you type each option for that function in the left-most column, and then put the reason you would, and would not, use that option for the tab's function in the next two columns. Your team gives each option a score, with 3 being the best choice, and 1 being the least desirable (multiple options may end up with the same score).
