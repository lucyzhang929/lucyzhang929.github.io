That function can be called from applications, on a schedule, or an API service. \r\n\r\nTo deploy the model so that you can use it in SQL Server, you will need to either copy the model to a location and SQL Server can read, load it into a binary column of a table in the SQL Server database, or train and call the model from T-SQL code using the `sp_execute_external_script` stored procedure. You'll follow that latter process in a moment.\r\n\r\nIf you are transferring a trained binary model in, you'll use code to create the  binary file *(called a pickle in Python, or a stream in R)* that contains the Model. There are other serialization methods available, including ONNX that you can use to store your model. If you use Azure Machine Learning Services, the Model is stored in the Cloud.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: The Model essentially contains the code from the final training. That means that the receiving system (SQL Server in this course) must be able to run that code, have the same libraries and so on.**\r\n\r\nIf you create the training for the model on a local system, it's important to use as similar data (as much as possible) for the model predictions. The data you trained with needs to represent as closely as possible the type of data you're scoring, or you could get incorrect results. \r\n\r\nIn this course, rather than store the model as a binary object, you'll just re-create the R code from the Data Scientist's Notebook, but adapt it for a stored procedure call using the Extensibility Framework you learned about earlier.\r\n",

This is common in K-Means or other unsupervised learning, but for labeled data its more common to train the Model, store it as a binary object, and then load that for the calls, making two steps instead of the combined single step you see here.\r\n\r\n- Run the following code on your Instance:",
