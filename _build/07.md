You're learning to use the Team Data Science Process to create a complete solution, using SQL Server as the platform. The phases in the Team Data Science process are:

<dl>
  <dt>1 - Business Understanding</dt>
  <dt>2 - Data Acquisition and Understanding</dt>
  <dt>3 - Modeling</dt>
  <dt>4 - Deployment </dt>
  <dt>5 - Customer Acceptance and Model Retraining <i>(This module)</i></dt>
<dl>

The final phase of the Team Data Science Process involves testing the model predictions on real-world queries to ensure that it meets all requirements. In this phase you will also document the project so that all parameters are well-known. Finally, a mechanism is evaluated to re-train the model. You will not cover the retraining portion of the process in this course.

### Goals for Customer Acceptance

- Confirm that the pipeline, the model, and their deployment in a production environment satisfy the customer's objectives
- Create a project close out document
- Create a path for retraining your model

### How to do it

- System validation: Confirm that the deployed model and pipeline meet the customer's needs.
- Project hand-off: Hand the project off to the entity that's going to run the system in production
- Develop a "ground truth" mechanism and feed the new labels (if applicable) back into the retraining API

You now have the clustering implemented in SQL Server. Why is that useful?

Well, imagine that you need to perform clustering on you customer data on a regular basis as new customers sign up to keep an updated understanding of customer behavior. In this example, your company might want to send out promotion emails - and now you can select the email addresses of customers in cluster 3 to send out a promotion.

You can also schedule jobs that run the stored procedure and automatically send the results to for example a CRM application or a reporting tool.


<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/checkbox.png?raw=true"><b>Activity: Apply the results</b></p>

The code below is selecting the email addresses of customers in cluster 3, for a promotion campaign.

- Run the code below in any tool you like:

<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```sql
USE [Analysis]
SELECT customer.[c_email_address], customer.c_customer_sk
  FROM dbo.customer
  JOIN
  [dbo].[customer_return_clusters] as r
  ON r.customer = customer.c_customer_sk
  WHERE r.cluster = 3
```
</div>

</div>

To complete the project, document the steps, findings, and results. In the activity that follows, you'll find a complete document reference for this process.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/checkbox.png?raw=true"><b>Activity: Create a Project Closeout Document</b></p>

- Open the `./assets/project/ProjectCloseout.md` file and fill in the fields from your project.

Congratulations! You have completed this course on SQL Server Machine Learning Services. You now have the tools, assets, and processes you need to extrapolate this information into other applications.
