# Workshop: Microsoft SQL Server Machine Learning Services

#### <i>A Microsoft Course from the SQL Server team</i>

## Project Methodology and Data Science

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/textbubble.png?raw=true">2.1 Creating a Data Science Project</h2>

This course covers the Process and Platform you can use for Data Science projects, using SQL Server 2019 (or higher). Using Machine Learning Services inside a database engine allows you to keep the data integrity you have built into your RDBMS, provides a high level of security, the ability to work on premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid fashion, and eliminates data travel outside your database environment. It also allows your data professionals to work in the area they know well, and still allow Data Scientists to work with R or Python to perform predictive, clustering, and categorical models with easy deployment. This course shows an example of training and deploying a Machine Learning model, making predictions on data in-house.

To begin, it's best to focus not on the technologies you will use, but the process you can follow to determine the best solution. It's important to involve the right team members in the project, especially where security is involved. The activities typically involved in an Advanced Analytics project contain the following steps:

The output of this project planning is a high level architecture diagram, and a Project Plan defining the team and the timelines.

During the Architecture Design Session *(ADS)* step, you will create your architecture. During the Implementation step, you will invoke the *Team Data Science Process*, which you'll focus on for the rest of this course.


<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pin.jpg?raw=true">2.2 The Data Science Process</h2>

If the discovery and architecture for the solution results in the need for a Prediction, Classification or Artificial Intelligence solution, you'll follow a Data Science process to understand the business requirements, examine the data from a customer database, create two experiments to find the best model, and deploy the completed model in a Stored Procedure that is called from a client application. This is in the Implementation step of the chart show above.

In this particular solution you'll set up your SQL Server environment and use a client tool to work with a database to create a predictive solution that you will deploy with a Stored Procedure.


<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pin.jpg?raw=true">2.2.1 Data Science</h2>

Data Science is an "umbrella" term that encompasses almost all Advanced Analytics. It combines the processes from working with data with technology, and also the scientific process.

[**NOTE:** You can learn more about the questions Data Science can answer here.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/data-science-for-beginners-series-the-5-questions-data-science-answers/)

<p>

To work in the Data Science field, it's helpful to have a background in various maths families (linear algebra, statistics, even formal logic), computing data technologies (such as programming in functional and object-oriented languages, database technologies such as NoSQL and RDBMS's, and "Big Data" areas such as Spark) and a "domain" of knowledge in some general area (finance, healthcare, government, manufacturing and such) or a broad knowledge in many industries.

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/NeedToKnow.png?raw=true" width="200">
<p>

The Data Scientist performs multiple types of analysis, from historical descriptive evaluations through predictive and prescriptive analysis.

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/TypesOfAnalysis.png?raw=true" width="500">
<p>

To do predictive and prescriptive analysis, the Data Science team leverages *Machine Learning*. Machine Learning technologies consume large amounts of data in the form of *Features* (columns of data that are predictive or classifying in nature) and *Labels* (the data you want to predict or classify). For instance, knowing where someone grew up or traveled to can give you insight into the types of food they might like to eat.

There are various "families" of algorithms that you can use to answer questions. They include the following:

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/MLCapabilities.png?raw=true" width="500">
<p>

Machine Learning uses algorithms to create (train) a completed *Model*. The training looks at various Features and "learns" how it affects a supplied "Label". It then selects the best path to work with data it has *not* seen. You can then send new data (Features) and the Model will return it's guess for the Label, usually along with how confident it is in the guess.

Machine Learning is used in both Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. You can see this interaction here:

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/AIDLProcess.png?raw=true" width="500">
<p>

Machine Learning, when layered in certain ways, forms the concept of *Deep Learning*. Machine Learning also forms the basis for Artificial Intelligence, which normally involves adding in "sensory" areas like vision, text and language.

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/AIProgression.png?raw=true" width="500">
<p>

There are various Platforms you can use to implement Machine Learning, such as Spark, Hadoop, AzureML and more. In this course you'll focus on using the SQL Server Platform to create, train, and deploy your completed predictive Model.

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pin.jpg?raw=true">2.2.2 A Brief overview of The Team Data Science Process</h2>

Now that you understand the technologies and Platforms behind Data Science, you need to understand a repeatable, scalable Process for your solutions.

While it's tempting to start with the algorithms and the outputs, it's actually more important to understand the general process of a Data Science project. To do that, you can use the *Team Data Science Process* - in fact, you have been studying many of these steps already:

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/tdsp.png?raw=true" width="500">
<p>

Each of these phases has a specific set of phases you follow to complete them. You'll work with each in the course modules that follow.





<h4>Phase One - Business Understanding</h4>

Read the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-business-understanding)

In this first step you identify the key business variables that the analysis needs to predict. We refer to these variables as the model targets, and we use the metrics associated with them to determine the success of the project.

You've actually already done this step in the first three phases of the project we've been creating. You can take the outputs you created and include them as the assets for this step described in the documentation reference.

<h4>Phase Two - Data Acquisition and Understanding</h4>

Read the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-data)

The Data Acquisition and Understanding phase of the TDSP you ingest or access data from various locations to answer the questions the organization has asked. In most cases, this data will be in multiple locations. Once the data is ingested into the system, you’ll need to examine it to see what it holds. All data needs cleaning, so after the inspection phase, you’ll replace missing values, add and change columns. You’ve already seen the Libraries you'll need to work with for Data Wrangling - Pandas being the most common in use.

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>
<h4>Phase Three - Modeling</h4>

In this phase, you will create the experiment runs, perform feature engineering, and run experiments with various settings and parameters. After selecting the best performing run, you will create a trained model and save it for operationalization in the next phase. This modeling is done with yet another set of Python Libraries - the most common being SciKit Learn and TensorFlow, You'll see this in action in just a bit.

Read the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-modeling)

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>
<h4>Phase Four - Deployment</h4>

In this phase you will take the trained model and any other necessary assets and deploy them to a system that will respond to API requests.

Read the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-deployment)

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>
<h4>Phase Five - Customer Acceptance</h4>

The final phase involves testing the model predictions on real-world queries to ensure that it meets all requirements. In this phase we also document the project so that all parameters are well-known. Finally, a mechanism is created to re-train the model.

Read the [Documentation Reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-acceptance)

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>


As you can see, there are quite a few things to do to in a Data Science Machine Learning project. Rather than have you create an entire solution, there is one you can examine to see each phase. You'll do that throughout the rest of this course.


<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/checkbox.png?raw=true"><b>Activity: Review/Create the Solution Architecture</b></p>

In this activity, you will review (or if time permits, create) the architecture for your solution. Open the *./assets/Project* folder for this course, and locate the *ADS Decision Tree.xlsx* file you see there.

NOTE: If you do not have Microsoft Excel installed, you can use the Visual Studio Excel Preview add-in by right-clicking the Excel file name in the Files area of the Explorer in Visual Studio Code - you can also <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/979860/supported-versions-of-the-office-viewers" target=_blank>install a viewer from this location</a>.

In an actual project, you would include the appropriate team members for each area, and document the discussions in the proper tab in the spreadsheet. For each area, you type each option for that function in the left-most column, and then put the reason you would, and would not, use that option for the tab's function in the next two columns. Your team gives each option a score, with 3 being the best choice, and 1 being the least desirable (multiple options may end up with the same score). Your team selects the option you want to suggest for that function. This exercise can take a few minutes, or several days, depending on how complex the solution becomes.

Rank each of the tab's options from highest to lowest, and then place the winning option on the "Rollup" tab, along with your justification of that choice.

This activity forms the basis of your solution, and it's diagram. For this course, you may only have time to examine each of these choices, but you should return to this process when you can spend more time on it.
